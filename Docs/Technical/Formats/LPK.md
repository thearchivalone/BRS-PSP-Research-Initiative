* Name: Light PaK
* Type: Data archive
* Extension: .lpk
* Header: LPK
* Purpose: Store data of similar or same types in a listed structure that can be quickly extracted due to being a small size
* Notes:
	* List based structure without direct encryption or compression for the most part; it's up to individual contents to handle this
	* Can either be a single archive with multiple files within or be multiple LPKs within (which aren't scripted for extraction yet due to having 
		a bit of a different structure)
	* Seems to be the standard way to store data outside of gzip compressed BIN or GZ archives
* Structure:
	* 0x04 - Number of files within the archive
	* 0x0c - List of all file offsets and sizes within the archive. See BRS-LPK.bms for how this particle section is structured. There's some math involved
