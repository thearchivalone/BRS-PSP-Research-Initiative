This repository will host my findings and various scripts, tools and documentation I've put together from diving into [Black Rock Shooter: The Game](https://web.archive.org/web/20150328084959/http://brs.jrpg.jp/) for the Playstation Portable handheld console. It's a work in progress and contributions are welcomed. All that I ask is that any projects that use anything from this repository will link back here and not claim ownership of anything within.

## How to Quickly Extract Most of the Game Data

* Download and install a modern version of Windows [Powershell](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/install/installing-powershell?view=powershell-7.4) *NOTE: Working on making this not a dependency for Linux, Mac, etc*

### Required for new Nim toolchain to work properly
* Download and install [git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)

* Download and install [Clang](https://clang.llvm.org/) *NOTE: Every platform installs this in a different way but it's my recommended C Compiler for cross-platform support*

* Create a `Game` folder in root directory (directory this Readme exists in)

* Create a region folder in that `Game` folder; this will be `usa` (for US release of game), `eur` (for European release), or `jpn` (for original Japanese release). *NOTE: You can create all three if you have them available; it's not fully tested but should work for those of you that want to work with all of the releases*

* Copy the `PSP_GAME` directory from a ripped and extracted release of *Black Rock Shooter: the Game* into the region folder you created above.

* Open a Terminal and enter this root directory

* Type `.\BRS-Extract.ps1` and hit enter to run this script

* If you don't have the `Tools` directory or any of the tools installed, it will ask you if you want to download and install them. Type 'y' to download.

* When prompted, choose what all you want to extract.

* Wait for the script to finish extracting the game files. This used to take 15+ minutes but current optimizations have drastically dropped that number. 

* All of the scripts will frequently receive updates for as long as they are needed to improve the process, so expect possible breakage from time to time but updating regularly hopefully won't be required as much. 

* NOTE: Depending on your security settings, Windows may say it can't run Powershell scripts. If this happens, you'll either need to run the script with elevated privileges or temporarily set your policy to allow it. See [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.security/set-executionpolicy?view=powershell-7.4) for more information

## Recommended Tools

* [QuickBMS](https://aluigi.altervista.org/quickbms.htm) - for running any scripts labeled with the `.bms` extension.

* [Cheat Engine](https://cheatengine.org) - for reading the game memory

* [PPSSPP](https://www.ppsspp.org/) - for playing the game (although, any PSP emulator or even the real hardware with proper tools should work)

* [HxD](https://mh-nexus.de/en/hxd/) - for reading the binaries and figuring out the structures of the game's internal workings

* [7-zip](https://www.7-zip.org/) - for extracting the game disc mostly. All of the main archive types can be extracted with BRS-extract.bms without the need of external tools.

* [K-Lite Mega Codec Pack](https://www.codecguide.com/download_k-lite_codec_pack_mega.htm) - Install this with all codec options selected, the audio files for the game won't need to be converted; converting can possibly make modding them an issue when reinjecting them or replacing them in the game (testing needed)

---

## Optional Tools

* [Offzip](https://aluigi.altervista.org/mytoolz/offzip.zip) - for extracting data from ZZZ archives; extraction script should work with all of these without issues now

* [Vgmstream-cli](https://github.com/vgmstream/vgmstream) - for converting at3 files into a user playable format; probably not needed if an audio editing tools is found that can work with the audio as is

## Navigating This Repository

The folder structure is meant to be pretty straight forward, but here's what they represent:

* Game - Where the game files go

* Scripts - QuickBMS scripts can be found here. See accompanying README in the directory and notes in the script if you need to learn how to use them. Also, feel free to open an issue and / or pull request (if you want to improve the documentation) if they're not clear enough.

* Docs/Repository - Mirror information, contributions, and other documentation related to the project as a whole can be found here

* Docs/Technical - Originally called Specifications, this is where you can find information about file formats, how certain systems work and (slowly, mind you) the file structure of the game disc

* Tools - Where the tools are downloaded and installed for extracting the game files; right now, this only supports Windows but shouldn't be difficult to get working on the BSDs, Linux, Mac, etc
